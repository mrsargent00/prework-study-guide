# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My first attempt at creating a website using HTML, CSS, Git ande JavaScript. I created this website as a base template of my starting point in my journey of Coding bootcamp. I have no experience in coding prior to this bootcamp, and I am very happy that I am able to learn a new skill. I never learned how to code, and the challenge of this was going off zero past experience with coding or using the programs that we are using for the bootcamp. I learned how to do the basic coding for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also learning how to use Git.
